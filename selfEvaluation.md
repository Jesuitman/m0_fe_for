# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `for` statement?

I feel very good in my understanding about for statements

- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?

I struggled a lot with marrying all of the concepts, especially in the practice. I am not sure if it was all the practice that helped my understanding of the assignment or if the actual assignment was easier. I struggled significantly less with the assignment thankfully. I had to do a lot of independent research to find the answers to the questions i had because I wanted to see if it was something i could solve on my own. i am glad i did the practice though and will be repeating the exercises every day this week to ingrain the knowledge. I unproductively struggled when I had been working for around 3 hours on the assignment so i decided to take a walk and eat lunch. coming back with a fresh mind helped. I definitely did have productive struggle too though.

- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?

I will be repeating the exercises in the practice all week to try and reinforce my knowledge

- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?

Google helped a lot for any questions but I will also be relying on my small group.
